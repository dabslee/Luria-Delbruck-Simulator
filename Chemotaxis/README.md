A simulation of a run-and-tumble chemotaxis on a linear chemical gradient. In a run-and-tumble chemotaxis, an organism compares the chemical concentration in its current state to that of its previous state, then moves towards or away from the previous state depending on its desire for that chemical.

Credit to my ISC231 course for teaching me about the experiment.

### How to Run
To run the program, simply use MATLAB to run the `runandtumble.m` file. This will generate two images: `runandtumbel_fullplot.png` and `runandtumble_zoomed.png`. Both of these images depict the same plot of the movement of the simulated organism over time, but with different axes limits.
