# Science Simulations
A collection of simulations based on famous labs. This README offers brief summaries about the different projects. View each project's folder to see specific features and run instructions.

            </a>
            <p>Offers a particle based simulation of 1D Brownian motion, then shows that it is analogous to a 1D random walk by comparing the dependences of displacement and mean-squared-distance to time. Also simulates random walks in n-dimensions, and shows visual animations of 1D, 2D, and 3D random walks.</p>

            <p>A simulator of the Luria-Delbrück Fluctuation Test, which showed that the "mutation hypothesis"--that mutations arose randomly independent of their environment--was correct, as opposed to the "acquired immunity hypothesis"--that mutations occured as an adaptive response to an environmental stimulus.</p>
