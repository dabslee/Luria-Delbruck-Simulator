LURIA-DELBRUCK FLUCTUATION TEST
Brandon Lee 2019
A simulator of the Luria-Delbruck Fluctuation Test, which showed that the "mutation
hypothesis"--that mutations arose randomly independent of their environment--was correct, as
opposed to the "acquired immunity hypothesis"--that mutations occured as an adaptive response to
an environmental stimulus.
